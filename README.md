#The Atlanta Commute Game

This text based game was written for the Terminal in Ruby. It was created for the MTAP technical interview and the concept was inspired by my father who has slight road rage everytime he commutes to Midtown from Alpharetta. 
Stories from this game may or may not be based on true events.
No matter how often you drive in Atlanta, you can relate to this game. 

THE GOAL
This includes ruby programming like loops, getting and storing data, and if/eslif/else conditions.
